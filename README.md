It's been fun, and wow have I learned a lot.  Influences from Prolog, Erlang, Clojure and Haskell have entered into my ideas for [jedi](https://github.com/gatesphere/jedi).  I've started more functional-style programming in Io, and I certainly do appreciate the more functional and metaprogramming sides of Lisp and Ruby.  Prolog is one of my old standbys, but a sudoku solver was an interesting treat.  Overall, this has been a great read.
